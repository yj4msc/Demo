### Geranium & Pelargonium
Pelargonium is a genus of flowering plants commonly known as geranium. Geranium is cultivated widely for their ornamental value but are also used in perfume production and both the scented flowers and leaves are edible.

### Nomenclature Confusion
 When pelargoniums were brought over from South Africa they were thought to be the same as the geranium, and thus were accidentally [misclassified](https://books.google.com/books?id=-bR8GxQ6BU0C&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=geranium+pelargonium+Charles+L%E2%80%99H%C3%A9ritier&source=bl&ots=4gO4oHrkaS&sig=ACfU3U2rlnJ01PtXbFbDl-OWUjBraEc_Rg&hl=zh-CN&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiVre_Py8nqAhUFCM0KHeQ0ANwQ6AEwAnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false). Linnaeus originally included all the species in one genus, Geranium, but they were later separated into two genera by Charles L’Héritier in 1789. Genetic testing has shed new light on Pelargonium classification, and will probably continue to do so.

The first species of Pelargonium known to be cultivated was P. triste, a native of South Africa. It was probably brought to the Botanical Garden in Leiden before 1600 on ships which had stopped at the Cape of Good Hope. However, pelargoniums were named geraniums because of their similarity to the herbaceous perennials.

### Pelargonium & Geranium Society (PAGS)
Established at the start of 2009, The Pelargonium & Geranium Society was founded to register and collect existed genera of plants named Geraniaceae, since there are currently almost 2000 hybridizers.

# Distribution 
<param title="pelargonium" eid="Q146118">

In North Africa, rose scented geranium was first introduced in 1847 in Algeria from Grasse (France). In Egypt, it was introduced by a Frenchman, Charles Garnier, by 1930. In China, geranium was introduced to the Yunnan Province by a state-owned company in the 1970s.

# Distillation
It is easy to understand why the many small farmers that plant it appreciate geranium as a cash crop. The oil is easily stored, and serves as a ‘savings’ account, allowing families to manage their expenditure when required.

In China, 5,000 to 7,000 families are involved in the production of geranium oil and around 25,000-30,000 people are involved in the whole supply chain.
